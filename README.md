# Assembly Sort

This program demonstrates the use of assembly language to generate an array of random integers, sort them, and display them to the user

## Built With

This program was written to be used with the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), and was tested using Visual Studio. This program uses several procedures from Kip Irvine's MASM library, available [here](http://kipirvine.com/asm/gettingStartedVS2017/index.htm)

## Use

Upon program startup, you will be prompted to choose how many integers you would like to be randomly generated, from 10-200. The program will then generate the given number of integers randomly in the range of 100-999. The list will be sorted and then displayed to the console.
